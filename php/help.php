<h3>Registering</h3>
<p>
	You will not be able to login until you have registered. If you have attempted to login without registering, the app will deny entry. Simply go back to the splash page, and select register. Enter your info and afterwards your login should work.

<h3>Empty or graphs with only one bar</h3>
<p>
   Often this is not even an issue, as it just means that not enough water has been used to create a graph, so this graph is empty, or has a single bar.
   This is an issue of your app not getting data correctly from your meter. To troubleshoot, reset the app. If not fixed, disconnect the app and then reconnect it.
