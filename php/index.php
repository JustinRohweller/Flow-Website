<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>
    Water conservation is of paramount importance in a time of drought, not only for environmental reasons, but financial reasons as well. Droughts can devastate an area not only by depriving it of drinking water, but also by causing the death of flora and fauna and by increasing wildfire risk. On top of that, utility companies impose higher prices on water when it is scarce. 40 million Californians in particular are facing constant reminders from the state government and their water districts to cut down on water consumption, but they lack the ability to individually quantify their water consumption. And Californians aren’t alone—people across the nation are missing out on opportunities to save on their water bills, since they don’t know how they are using their water. This makes it much more difficult for them to effectively conserve water (and thereby save money).

<h3>How We Fix It</h3>
<p>
    Flow will allow its users to install smart meters on individual appliances in order to track water usage, which can be monitored in an app. This will allow users to track water usage for individual showerheads, faucets, or appliances. Additionally, Flow will be used to detect if a faucet has been left on by allowing the user to monitor their water consumption (and potentially close off such a faucet) even when away from home, which will increase home safety. By tracking individual appliances, the consumer will be better equipped to find water-greedy appliances and make changes that will conserve not only water, but also money.
