The Chinese Zodiac
The Chinese animal zodiac is not like the calendar that us Americans are used to. It is a repeating cycle of 12 years, with each year being represented by an animal and its reputed attributes. Traditionally these zodiac animals were used to date the years, but the symbolism of the animals goes much deeper than tracking dates and lengths of time in history. Also, while the calendar may be a popular icon of eastern culture in the West, it is a fundamental part of many other East Asian nations, including China, Vietnam, Burma, Korea, Japan, Mongolia, Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, as well as the Buddhist calendar.

The twelve symbolic animals that the calendar is made up of are as follows: Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, Pig. Each year a new animal becomes the zodiac animal, and the pattern repeats once per twelve years. The pattern never changes.

For each of the twelve animals, there are specific character traits and descriptions for the animals. This is important and relevant because everyone’s birth year is associated directly with the zodiac year that they were born on. In other words, those born in the year of the Ox supposedly share very specific character traits to all other people who were also born in the year of the Ox. 

Each person’s Chinese Zodiac sign is derived from your birth year, according to the Chinese lunar calendar. In order to better understand which years are linked to which animal, here is a list of all of the zodiac animals and the years that they were or will be the zodiac animal over the past few decades.
